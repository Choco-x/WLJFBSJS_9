# P10.
Each value in the distance vector D(x) is non-increasing because value will only update an item if only if it receives a smaller value, which means an item will never be replaced by a larger value.   
It will eventually stabilize in a finite number of steps because if it doesn't stabilize, then each step some item will become smaller, due to it is non-increasing. If it never stabilize, then each time some item will become smaller, and then after enough steps, some item will become negative, which is impossible. Besides, once in some step there is no change, then there won't be any change in next steps.

No. Z won't know whether a traffic from Y is originated from Y or X.
